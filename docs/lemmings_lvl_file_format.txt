document revision 0.0

thanks to TalveSturges for the original alt.lemmings posting which got me
started on decoding the .lvl format

if you liked lemmings you should give CLONES a try. go to www.tomkorp.com
for more information.

this document will explain how to interpret the lemmings .lvl level
file for the windows version of lemmings (directly saved levels in LemEdit).

values preceded by 0x are hex values

a lemmings .lvl file is 2048 bytes ( 0x0000 to 0x07FF )

==GLOBALS===============================================================

BYTES 0x0000 to 0x0001
Release Rate	: 0x0000 is slowest, 0x00FA is fastest

BYTES 0x0002 to 0x0003
Num of lemmings	: maximum 0x0072.  0x0010 would be 16 lemmings.

BYTES 0x0004 to 0x0005
Num to rescue	: should be less than or equal to number of lemmings

BYTES 0x0006 to 0x0007
Time Limit	: max 0x00FF, 0x0001 to 0x0009 works best

BYTES 0x0008 to 0x0017 (2 bytes each, only lower byte is used)
Num of skills	: max 0x00FA.  order is Climber, Floater, Bomber,
		  Blocker,Builder, Basher, Miner, Digger

BYTES 0x0018 to 0x0019
Start screen xpos : 0x0000 to 0x04F0.  is rounded to nearest multiple
		    of 8.

BYTES 0x001A to 0x001B
Normal Graphic Set: 0x0000 is dirt, 0x0001 is fire, 0x0002 is squasher, 
		    0x0003 is pillar,0x0004 is crystal, 0x0005 is brick,
		    0x0006 is rock, 0x0007 is snow and 0x0008 is bubble.

BYTES 0x001C to 0x001D
Extended Graphic Set: Apparently ignored in windows version.

BYTES 0x001E to 0x001F
Something?	: doesn't seem to matter what goes here.  use 0x0000.

==OBJECTS===============================================================
BYTES 0x0020 to 0x011F (8 byte blocks)

x pos  : min 0xFFF8, max 0x0638.  0xFFF8 = -24, 0x0001 = -16, 0x0008 = -8
         0x0010 = 0, 0x0018 = 8, ... , 0x0638 = 1576
	 note: should be multiples of 8

y pos  : min 0xFFD7, max 0x009F.  0xFFD7 = -41, 0xFFF8 = -8, 0xFFFF = -1
	 0x0000 = 0, ... , 0x009F = 159.  
	 note: can be any value in the specified range

obj id : min 0x0000, max 0x000F.  the object id is different in each
	 graphics set, however 0x0000 is always an exit and 0x0001 is
 	 always a start.  
	 note: see appendix a for full object listings

modifier : first byte can be 80 (do not overwrite existing terrain) or 40
	   (must have terrain underneath to be visible). 00 specifies always
	   draw full graphic.
	   second byte can be 8F (display graphic upside-down) or 0F (display
 	   graphic normally)

each 8 byte block starting at byte 0x0020 represents an interactive object. there
can be a maximum of 32 objects.  write 0x00 to fill bytes up to 0x0120 if
there are less than 32 objects.

==TERRAIN===============================================================
BYTES 0x0120 to 0x075F (4 byte blocks)

x pos : min 0x0000, max 0x063F.  0x0000 = -16, 0x0008 = -8, 0x0010 = 0,
	0x063f = 1583.
	note: the xpos also contains modifiers.  the first nibble can be
	8 (do no overwrite existing terrain), 4 (display upside-down), or
	2 (remove terrain instead of add it). you can add them together.
	0 indicates normal.
	eg: 0xC011 means draw at xpos=1, do not overwirte, upside-down.

y pos : 9-bit value. min 0xEF0, max 0x518.  0xEF0 = -38, 0xEF8 = -37,
	0x020 = 0, 0x028 = 1, 0x030 = 2, 0x038 = 3, ... , 0x518 = 159
	note: the ypos value bleeds into the next value since it is 9bits.

terrain id: min 0x00, max 0x3F.  not all graphic sets have all 64 graphics.

each 4 byte block starting at byte 0x0120 represents a terrain object. 
there can be a maximum of 400 terrain objects.  write 0xFF fill the bytes
up to byte 0x0760 if need be.

==STEEL AREAS===============================================================
BYTES 0x0760 to 0x07DF (4 byte blocks)

x pos : 9-bit value.  min 0x000, max 0xC78.  0x000 = -16, 0x008 = -12,
	0x010 = -8, 0x018 = -4, ... , 0xC78 = 1580.
	note: each hex value represents 4 pixels.  since it is 9 bit value it
	      bleeds into the next attribute.

y pos : min 0x00, max 0x27. 0x00 = 0, 0x01 = 4, 0x02 = 8, ... , 0x27 = 156
	note: each hex value represents 4 pixels

area : min 0x00, max 0xFF.  the first nibble is the x-size, from 0 - F.
       each value represents 4 pixels. the second nibble is the y-size.
       0x00 = (4,4), 0x11 = (8,8), 0x7F = (32,64), 0x23 = (12,16)

eg: 00 9F 52 00 = put steel at (-12,124) width = 24, height = 12

each 4 byte block starting at byte 0x0760 represents a steel area which 
the lemmings cannot bash through.  the first three bytes are given above,
and the last byte is always 00.. what a waste of space considering how
compact they made the first 3 bytes!  write 0x00 to fill each byte up to
0x07E0 if need be.

==LEVEL NAME==============================================================
BYTES 0x07E0 to 0x07FF

a character string 32 bytes long. write 0x20 (space) to fill up the empty
bytes.
